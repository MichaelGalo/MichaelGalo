## Hey there, I'm Michael  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior full-stack web developer entering the tech industry from the side-door.

Transitioning from a first career in non-profit marketing & communications, I hadn't quite found the analytical challenge I was craving in my career. Combine this with a lego-filled childhood and the door never opened named **engineering**, I decided to take that a leap of faith into a new realm: **software**. 

After learning to solve real-life headaches with code, I discovered an intoxicating recipe of logic, creativity, imposter syndrome and deep fulfillment in the projects I was working on. After that, I knew I wasn't going back. This is the most fun I've had with my work in years. I can't wait to see how many more surprises software development has in store for me and how I can turn novel ideas into apps that make people smile.
