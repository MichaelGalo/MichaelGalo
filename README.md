## Hey there, I'm Michael  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior full-stack web developer entering the tech industry from the side-door.

Transitioning from a first career in marketing & communications primarily for non-profits & B-Corp brands, I hadn't quite found the analytical challenge I was craving in my career. Combine this with a lego-filled childhood and the university path never walked named **computer science**, I decided to take Dolly's advice and pave my own path into: **software development**.

After learning to solve some real-life headaches with code, I discovered an intoxicating recipe of logic, creativity, humbling debugging and deep fulfillment in the projects I was working on. After that, I knew I wasn't going back. This is the most fun I've had with my work in years and my brain was beings stretched more than ever. I can't wait to see how many more surprises software development has in store for me and how I can continue to turn novel ideas into apps that make an impact, solve problems, and make people smile.
